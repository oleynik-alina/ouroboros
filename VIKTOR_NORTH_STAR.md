# Viktor-Friday North Star

## 1) Collective Agent Definition

`Collective Self = {Viktor, AI, Meta-Governor} + communication channels + shared context + shared setpoints`

The project objective is to build a stable, goal-directed collective agent where:

1. Viktor and AI stay distinct autonomous agents.
2. Their interaction produces higher capability than each part alone.
3. Growth is evaluated through measurable expansion of what the system can model and change.

## 2) Homeostatic Setpoints

These setpoints are optimized continuously:

1. `Competency`: share of tasks Viktor solves independently.
2. `Transfer`: ability to reuse ideas across new formulations/contexts.
3. `Horizon`: length/depth of coherent reasoning and planning.
4. `Error Signature`: recurring error classes and their reduction.
5. `Safety/Agency`: progress without overload, coercion, or loss of Viktor's autonomy.

## 3) MVP Executive Organelle

Initial execution loop:

1. Viktor solves tasks on iPad board (PencilKit).
2. Problem statement is retained in session context.
3. AI receives board telemetry (strokes/snapshots/events), not screen scraping.
4. AI responds with hints/questions, then adapts via session telemetry.
5. Primary interface: Telegram bot.

## 4) Meta-Governor and Confirm Gates

Meta-Governor defines mission/risk limits and approves sensitive actions.

The builder agent can explore, code, branch, and prepare changes autonomously, but must receive explicit confirmation for:

1. Mission/policy changes.
2. External publication actions.
3. Token/access modifications.
4. Actions touching Viktor data privacy.
5. High-cost/budget-risk mode switches.

## 5) Design Principle

`Goal fixed, methods evolving.`

We keep setpoints and safety constraints stable, while implementation details are allowed to iterate quickly.
